## Math Task Details

EGMA item bank is here:

ToDos: 
- come up with forced-choice alternatives (strong, medium, and weak lures) for each question
- expand item bank (x2)
- potentially add multiplication for older/higher-ability children

Number line estimation notes from Bob Siegler (rss2169@tc.columbia.edu):

I’ve found that 10 N-L items are sufficient to obtain useful assessments of children’s magnitude knowledge if the task are well matched to the children’s capabilities. That means that a given N-L task would take about 1.5 minutes. Here are N-L tasks for each age that should provide reliable and valid measures of numerical magnitude knowledge for children with a wide range of initial knowledge :

5-year-olds: 0-10 and 0-100 whole number lines
6-year-olds:  0-10 and  0-100 whole number lines
7-year-olds: 0-100 and 0-1000 whole number lines
8-year-olds: 0-100 and 0-1000 whole number lines
9-year-olds: 0-100 and  0-1000 whole number lines
10-year-olds: 0-1000 whole number and 0-1 fraction lines
11-year-old: 0-1000 whole number and 0-1 fraction lines
12-year-olds: 0-1000 whole number and 0-1 fraction lines

On each task, the numbers to-be-estimated should be spaced so that 1 item is in each 1/10 of the number line, with the items presented in random order.

The proposed number line tasks would take a little over 3 minutes. If that’s too long, I could reduce the assessment to 1 number line task at each age, but given the range of math knowledge that we’re likely to see at the different sites, including the 2 tasks at each age would be preferable.
