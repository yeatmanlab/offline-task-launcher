## Sentence Comprehension Task


From Maggie Snowling (maggie.snowling@psy.ox.ac.uk):
I enclose the sentences we have generated for our reading comp test alongside the distractors.  You will see they are based around the TROG1 items.  We are currently having the test programmed and drawings finalised. I wonder if we could use this format to generate parallel items for a Levante oral version?   

Taking it down to age 2 might require some thought about presentation format https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/lang.12332?casa_token=fI1UBHTJMVQAAAAA%3ABGwhqLGIC__lKo6BIgbAKBBPMMKkfJa-GFt3ceJC_sVbxH7hLBmArin6w7TYlWZgU-l8UlKg8WBM_A


(What about ROAR Sentence Reading T/F task?)
